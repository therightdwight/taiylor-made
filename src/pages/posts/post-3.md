I have been able to add a few pages and I am learning quickly.

I am thankful that learning the Astro framework so far has been hassle-free and the tutorial has gently held my hand throughout. 

I can't wait to learn about adding CSS so I can make this all look pretty. 

For one of my `const` variables I added `wifeAttributes` and was able to make a learning moment cute lol.
